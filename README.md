The notebook antibody_generation_transformer.ipynb trains and evaluates a transformer variant for antibody sequence generation using data from the data folder. Antibodies can afterwards be generated by temperature sampling and heatmaps of the multi-headed self-attention weights obtained by a given model can be computed. 
The notebook transformer_binding_classifier.ipynb trains and evaluates a classification transformer variant for antibody binding classification using data from the data folder.
